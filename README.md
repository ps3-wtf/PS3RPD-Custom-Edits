## Download
* [version 1.9.4 .exe](https://github.com/zorua98741/PS3-Rich-Presence-for-Discord/releases/download/v1.9.4/PS3RPD.exe)  
or

### Note
The executable file will very likely be flagged as a virus on your computer due to pyinstaller being used to compile it.
As far as I know, there is nothing I can do to fix this.

## Limitations
* __A PC must be used to display presence, there is no way to install and use this script solely on the PS3__
* The script relies on webmanMOD, and a major change to it will break this script, please message me about updated versions of webman so that i can test the script with them
* PSX and PS2 game name depends on the name of the file
* PSX and PS2 game detection will **not** work on PSN .pkg versions because webman cannot show those games as mounted/playing.
* PS2 ISO game detection can be inconsistent, varying on degree of consistency by the value of "Refresh time."
* Using Windows 7 is only possible with up to PS3RPD version 1.7.2
	- If you want to use a .exe, [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ezzlcemhkmnmyn2/PS3RPD.exe/file) is a version that may or may not fully function (very little bug testing has been done)

## Usage

### Requirements
* PS3 with either HFW&HEN, or CFW installed
* PS3 with [webmanMOD](https://github.com/aldostools/webMAN-MOD/releases) installed 
* PS3 and PC on the same network/internet connection
* Discord installed and open on the PC running the script
* Administrator permissions on the PC
* A Python 3.9 interpreter installed on the PC if you do not wish to use the executable file

### Installing as a Windows service (optional)
Download [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/release/nssm-2.24.zip) and run `nssm install <service name ie. ps3rpd>` to install PS3RPD as a Windows service.
WARNING: PS3RPD.exe must be in a location that won't change ie. C:\ps3rpd\PS3RPD.exe

## Additional Information

### External config file
PS3RPD makes use of an external config file to persistently store a few variables, on creation, the default values will be:
* Your PS3's IP address 	(where the script will find your PS3 on the network)
* My Discord developer application's ID 		(where the script will send presence data to)
* A refresh time of 35 seconds 					(how often to get new data (minimum value of 15 seconds)
* To show the PS3's temperature
* To use a shared cover for PS2&PSX games
* To display the time elapsed


### Using your own images
If you'd like to control what images are used for each game, you must create a Discord Developer Application over at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once created, copy the application ID from the Developer Portal and paste it into the external `config.json`, replacing the value of `client_id`.

You are now able to upload your own assets in the Developer Portal under `Rich Presence > Art Assets`. Note that the name of the asset uploaded must be the lowercase title ID provided in the script's output. (e.g. `abcd12345`)
